## About Full Stack 

The main purpose of the project is to practice creating APIs and using APIs to build interactive user interfaces.

In this project, the backend is created to generate API that is to be used in the front end. This API is created using Flask and SQL ALCHEMY. In the back end, after running server.py which is connected to the MySQL database, the API is generated. The API is tested with Postman, and after passing the test, it is used in the front end to perform CRUD operations. 

In the front end, CRUD operations are performed to retrieve, add, update, and delete data from API. The whole project is styled using REACT BOOTSTRAP AND CSS.
